# Website in development for Smart Furniture Factory in Argentina
The idea here is to showcase all the models that can be built and also contact sellers for not existing designs as they build personalised smart furniture.

The site is still in development and was put on a side since client had some issue that he had to attend as well as he moved the company from Argentina to Spain still being in the process to legalise all it's departments.
